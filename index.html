                            Cleveland, Ohio is a truly
                            hidden
                            gem.
                            Earthquakes are
                            surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which
                            have
                            registered with a
                            magnitude of 2

                            will presumably
                            be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach
